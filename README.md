# NLP - Text Distance Calculation

Calculate the distance of two texts.

## Current functionalities
* Cosine Similarity
* Jaccard Similarity

## Installation
Install the Clojure CLI, following the [documentation](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure).
For me, it worked well to install it in the WSL.

## Usage
Within a terminal or the WSL - depending on were you have installed the Clojure CLI - navigate to the project root directory.
Run:
```bash
clj -M -m text-distance.core Text1 Text2
```
